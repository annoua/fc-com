### 1.5 Overview

This document contains the Architectural Representation, Goals and Constraints as well as the Logical, Deployment, Implementation and Data Views.

## 2. Architectural Representation

The backend and the frontend are both developed separted from each other and only communicate over a REST API. That said, it is hard to follow one of the
known patterns (MVC, MVP, MVVM) for the whole project. The frontend is based on the on the Redux pattern that is inspired by Facebook's Flux architecture. 
Redux is a JavaScript library that is able to manage the applications state. 

![Redux Pattern](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZX00M-DmsrigKap7wzGoQQ.png)

The so called actions are representing the interface to our backend as REST API endpoints
are fetched here. The fetched data is then send to the reducers.

For more, see [Thinking in Redux](https://hackernoon.com/thinking-in-redux-when-all-youve-known-is-mvc-c78a74d35133).

The backend however represents a controller and model. It simply follows the MVC pattern, but the view is replaced by the whole Redux pattern. The controller does the endpoint mapping whereas the model represents the possible models that are needed for this project (e.g. user, flashcards).

## 2.1 Technologies used
Our two main technologies used are described in the following.

### Spring Boot (Backend)
Spring Boot is built on top of the Java Spring framework and provides the developer with helpful features to create and run web applications. In our case, a REST Web Service
which represents the interface between our front- and backend. As we want to benefit from the newest features of Java 10, the platform this service will be hosted on 
needs to support Java 10 or higher.

### ReactJS (Frontend)
ReactJS helps building interactive UIs that can be updated dynamically and therefore eliminate the need to refresh the web application. One can also develop single 
components and can reuse them all over the application. Such a component could be a login form, a profile card or anything else one wants to reuse. We are going to 
import a React framework called Material-UI that provides a lot of pre-defined components. Its design based on, oh wonder, the Material-Design. The development will
take place with the newest version of JavaScript. Fortunately, our development environment is able to compile it to the lower version of JavaScript. Thus, we can
use the newest features without having to worry about browser compatibility. 
Furthermore we will extend ReactJS with Redux. Redux allows us to keep track of state changes in the frontend and is able to notify other components about it.

## 3. Architectural Goals and Constraints

Following a closer description of the front- and backend.

### Frontend

While the frontend is based on ReactJS, it is enhanced by [Redux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redux_(JavaScript_library)). In opposite to well known patterns like MVC, its dataflow is unidirectional. 

* Actions: As the name may already implies, actions react to events triggered by the user. They describe what happen on such events (e.g. user tries to authenticate).
* Reducer: A reducer specifies how to state of the application changes in response the called actions (e.g. user authenticated is now true) 
* Store: The store contains all the states and brings them all together to provide them all over the application. 

### Backend

The backend is written in Java and holds all the models that are needed (e.g. users, flashcards) and is able to provide the data with the help of a RestController. This is being developed with Springs dependency, Spring Boot. To store the data it communicatres with a MySQL database.

* Model: Specific classes that represent single objects such as users or flashcards.
* Controller: A RestController that does the mapping of the REST API endpoints.

## 5. Logical View

The following section provides a graphical representation of our backend. Reasons for the missing View can be found under [Architectural Representation](#2-architectural-representation) and the following section.
### 5.1 Overview

Since the projects front- and backend communicate over a REST API, it is not possible to auto generate the full architecture in one diagram. 
To be specific, React and Redux don't use classes as known from Java or other object oriented languages. The following picture describes
the backends model and controller at least.

## 11. Quality/Metrics

To ensure the quality of our frontend, we implemented UI tests with the help of Testcaf√©. Within, we created different scenarios to test every case that could possibly throw errors.
