## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration. It describes the approach to testing the software.
The Test Plan for FlashCardCommunity supports the following objectives:

-   Identifying the items that should be targeted by the tests.
-   Identifying the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered.
-   Outlining the testing approach that will be used.
-   Identifying the required resources and provides an estimate of the test efforts.

### 1.2 Scope

This test plan will assure the functionality of the application's front end, back end and the communication between the two.
This document shows the following types of testing: UI-, API and Unit Testing.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

The intended audience of this test plan are the developers themself. It is meant to provide orientation to the developers to work from and as a documentation to measure the fullfillment of quality requirements against.

## 2. Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation

### 2.1 Background

Testing serves to ensure that the written code does what it is intended to do. It also prevents future code changes to break existing functionality unnoticed. In the context of integration it can also prevent broken software states to be merged into secured VC branches

### 2.2 Evaluation Mission

Testing is a crucial phase in the development cycle. It is necessary in order to fix technical bugs and important functional problems. With TDD we define the test first and can fix bugs before they even occur.

### 2.3 Test Motivators

The tests are done to ensure quality and mitigate risks and fulfill functional requirements. Their purpose is to provide stability for our application.

## 3. Target Test Items

The following lists represent the tested parts of this application:

-   ReactJS frontend / Webapp
-   Server backend (and APIs)

## 4. Outline of Planned Tests

### 4.1 Outline of Test Inclusions

_Frontend: ReactJS_:

-   UI testing

_Backend: Spring Boot Application_:

-   API testing
-   Unit testing

### 4.2 Outline of Other Candidates for Potential Inclusion

n/a

### 4.3 Outline of Test Exclusions

Due missing time and ressources we won't focus on the following:

-   Stress test
-   Load/performance tests
-   Usability tests

Not testing stress, performance etc. does not mean that we will not think about such things when developing!

## 5. Test Approach

### 5.1 Testing Techniques and Types

#### 5.1.1 Unit Testing

Unit testing ensures, that the tested sourcecode works as expected. Therefore small parts of the sourcecode are tested independently.

TBD

#### 5.1.2 User Interface Testing

By UI testing the application is tested from the perspective of the user. The goal of UI testing is to ensure that the UI behaves as expected.

|                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Technique Objective    | Test application automated from the perspective of the user through UI Test                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Technique              | Writing Gherkin `.feature` files with clearly defined steps and the expected result. Then running Testcaf√© to automatically check if they succeed or fail.  [Further information](https://flashcardcommunity.wordpress.com/2018/11/04/hw-week-5-acceptance-tests-with-cucumber/). |
| Oracles                | Expect that the steps of the tests are logged to the command line and be marked as successful.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Required Tools         | Dependencies of [Cucumber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cucumber) and [Testcaf√©](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testcafe)                                                                                                                                                         |
| Success Criteria       | All UI tests pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Special Considerations | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### 5.1.3 API Testing

API Testing is used to ensure that the communication between the front- and backend is working as expected. API Testing is commonly a part of Integration Testing which means that multiple parts of the application are tested together.

## 7. Deliverables

## 7.1 Test Evaluation Summaries

The project contains tests in the front- and backend. Currently UI Testing and API Testing can not be done within our CI/CD Pipelines as our UI tests partly depend on a running backend which is not the case. However, the Unit tests in backend will be triggered each time the whole project is getting build by our CI/CD Pipelines at Travis CI (each commit). On top of that, we also use Codacy to check our code quality (depending on specific style rules) which is also getting triggered each commit.

-   [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/project/FlashCardCommunity/fc-com/dashboard)
-   [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/phoenixfeder/fc-com)
-   [UI Testing](https://flashcardcommunity.wordpress.com/2018/11/04/hw-week-5-acceptance-tests-with-cucumber/)

## 7.2 Reporting on Test Coverage

TBD

## 7.3 Perceived Quality Reports

-   [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/project/FlashCardCommunity/fc-com/dashboard)

## 7.4 Incident Logs and Change Requests

Codacy as well as TravisCI is able to integrate in our GitHub repository. For each pull request created, Codacy will give information about the Codequality and TravisCI will tell if the build succeeds or fail.

-   [Codacy pull requests](https://app.codacy.com/app/FlashCardCommunity/fc-com/mergedPullRequests)

## 7.5 Smoke Test Suite and Supporting Test Scripts

The automated test execution in our CI/CD Pipeline enables regression testing. With this approach it is clearly visible when changes break existing functions and affect the correct behaviour of the application.

## 8. Testing Workflow

1) Local testing on the developers machines
2) Commits trigger building (including Unit test) on TravisCI
3) For each new pull requests code quality will also be analyzed

## 9. Environmental Needs
