## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration. It describes the approach to testing the software.
The Test Plan for FlashCardCommunity supports the following objectives:

-   Identifying the items that should be targeted by the tests.
-   Identifying the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered.
-   Outlining the testing approach that will be used.
-   Identifying the required resources and provides an estimate of the test efforts.

### 1.2 Scope

This test plan will assure the functionality of the application's front end, back end and the communication between the two.
This document shows the following types of testing: UI-, API and Unit Testing.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

The intended audience of this test plan are the developers themself. This document is on a technical level so it is for more advanced readers who need the necessary background knowledge.

## 2. Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation

### 2.1 Background

Testing serves to ensure that the written code does what it is intended to do. It also prevents future code changes to break existing functionality unnoticed. Code coverage can give us information about how well our application is covered with tests.
In the context of integration testing can also prevent broken software states to be merged into secured VC branches and only stable versions of our project will be deployed.

### 2.2 Evaluation Mission

Testing is a crucial phase in the development cycle. It is necessary in order to fix technical bugs and important functional problems. With TDD tests are written before the functional code is implemented. This helps preventing bugs before they even occur.

### 2.3 Test Motivators

The tests are done to ensure quality and mitigate risks and fulfill functional requirements. Their purpose is to provide stability for our application and to detect bugs faster than by manual testing.

## 3. Target Test Items

The following lists represent the tested parts of this application:

-   ReactJS frontend / Webapp
-   Java Spring Server backend (and APIs)

## 4. Outline of Planned Tests

### 4.1 Outline of Test Inclusions

_Frontend: ReactJS_:

-   UI testing

_Backend: Spring Boot Application_:

-   API testing
-   Unit testing

### 4.2 Outline of Other Candidates for Potential Inclusion

n/a

### 4.3 Outline of Test Exclusions

Due missing time and ressources we won't focus on the following:

-   Stress test
-   Load/performance tests
-   Usability tests

Not testing stress, performance etc. does not mean that we will not think about such things when developing!

## 5. Test Approach

### 5.1 Testing Techniques and Types

#### 5.1.1 Unit Testing

Unit testing ensures, that the tested sourcecode works as expected. Therefore small parts of the sourcecode are tested independently.

To be implemented.

#### 5.1.2 User Interface Testing

By UI testing the application is tested from the perspective of the user. The goal of UI testing is to ensure that the UI behaves as expected.

#### 5.1.3 API Testing

API Testing is used to ensure that the communication between the front- and backend is working as expected. API Testing is commonly a part of Integration Testing which means that multiple parts of the application are tested together.

| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Technique Objective    | Test backend APIs automated.                                                                                           |
| Technique              | Write a Postman collection of API queries and test if they all succeed by running the generated JSON file with Newman. |
| Oracles                | Expect that the steps of the tests are logged to the command line and be marked as successful.                         |
| Required Tools         | [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) and [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman)                              |
| Success Criteria       | All API tests pass.                                                                                                    |
| Special Considerations | -                                                                                                                      |

## 6. Entry and Exit Criteria

### 6.1 Test Plan

#### 6.1.1 Test Plan Entry Criteria

The whole test process is started as soon changes are pushed to our GitHub repository.

#### 6.1.2 Test Plan Exit Criteria

The test process ends as soon as all tests succeeded or one failed.

## 7. Deliverables

## 7.1 Test Evaluation Summaries

The project contains tests in the front- and backend that run each push to our GitHub repository. On top of that, we also use Codacy to check our code quality (depending on specific style rules) which is also getting triggered each commit.

-   [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/project/FlashCardCommunity/fc-com/dashboard), Badge: ![Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/95260a54312140bf99814090ab89a940?isInternal=true)

## 7.3 Perceived Quality Reports

-   [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/project/FlashCardCommunity/fc-com/dashboard)

## 7.4 Incident Logs and Change Requests

Codacy as well as TravisCI is able to integrate in our GitHub repository. For each pull request created, Codacy will give information about the Codequality and TravisCI will tell if the build succeeds or fail.

![pr](graphics/ci.png)

## 7.5 Smoke Test Suite and Supporting Test Scripts

Every new push to any branch triggers an execution in our CI/CD pipeline. This way we have an immediate feedback when a new commit breaks any functionallity of our application or limits the users actions.

## 8. Testing Workflow

Our testing workflow is like the following:

1) Local testing on the developers machines
2) Commits trigger building (including Unit test) on TravisCI
3) With each pull requests code quality will also be analyzed
